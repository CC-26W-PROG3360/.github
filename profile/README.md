_Helping Global Small Businesses Scale Without Breaking Their Software_

## 🧭 Who We Are

**Northstar Platform Inc.** is a fictional Canada-based technology company designed for the _PROG3360: Software Delivery & Release Management, Section 2 Winter 2026 Class_ in a real-world, enterprise context.

Northstar Platform Inc. is a fictional, Canada-based technology company founded by immigrants and second-generation Canadians who set out to solve a problem they understood personally: how small and mid-sized businesses around the world coordinate work, deliveries, and communication with limited tools and even less margin for failure.

Northstar exists to help businesses operate reliably across borders, cultures, and time zones and to do so with software that can actually scale.

This repository represents the core platform and delivery systems you will work on as part of the Software Delivery & Release Management course.

## 🌍 The Origin Story

Northstar began as a logistics and service-enablement platform designed to help small businesses:

- Coordinate deliveries
- Manage service bookings
- Send customer notifications
- Integrate with local partners and aggregators

The early customer base reflected the founders’ own backgrounds and networks:
- Canadian SMEs 🇨🇦
- Indian service marketplaces 🇮🇳
- Nigerian logistics aggregators 🇳🇬
- Chinese exporters & fulfillment partners 🇨🇳

The product solved real problems and adoption was fast. 

Too fast.

## ⚠️ Growth Exposed the Cracks

As usage increased across regions, the platform began to strain under the weight of its own success.

Engineering challenges started piling up:

- Manual deployments
- Inconsistent environments
- Snowflake servers
- “It works on my machine” becoming a weekly phrase
- Little visibility into what was deployed, where, and when

Then it happened.

A major outage during last year peak season. This is the kind every experienced engineer has lived through at least once.

Orders backed up. Notifications failed. Teams scrambled. Trust took a hit.

The platform survived but leadership realized something critical:

> The problem wasn’t the code.
> The problem was how the code was delivered.

## 🚀 Why This Modernization Matters

Northstar’s leadership made a strategic decision to modernize its software delivery and release practices before expanding further.

That’s where you come in.

```

Similar to a real production system, this repository and structure will evolve over time.

## 🚦 Environments

Northstar operates multiple environments to support safe delivery:

- Development – fast iteration
- Staging – automated validation
- UAT – production-like verification
- Production – customer-facing workloads

Promotion between environments is intentional, automated, and auditable.

**We will no longer stand for _cowboy deployments_**.

## 📜 Engineering Principles

At Northstar, we believe and live by the following principles:

- Automation beats heroics
- Small changes reduce risk
- Repeatability builds trust
- Visibility prevents surprises
- Failures are learning opportunities, not blame games

If something breaks, we fix the system that allowed it to break.

--- 

## 🎓 How This Course Is Different

Most courses teach tools in isolation.

This course teaches **how real systems are delivered under pressure.**

You will:

- Make tradeoffs
- Defend design decisions
- Break things (safely)
- Learn how delivery failures actually happen
- Learn how to prevent them

By the end, you won’t just understand CI/CD, you’ll understand why companies live or die by it.
